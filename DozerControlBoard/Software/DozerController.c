 * Project name:
     HID Read Write Polling (USB HID Read & Write Test)
 * Copyright:
     (c) MikroElektronika, 2005-2010
 * Revision History:
     20100512:
       - initial release;
 * Description:
     This example establishes connection with the HID terminal that is active
     on the PC. Upon connection establishment, the HID Device Name will appear
     in the respective window. The character that user sends to PIC from the HID
     terminal will be re-sent back to user.
 * Test configuration:
     MCU:             PIC18F4550
                      http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/39632D.pdf
     Dev.Board:       EasyPIC7
                      http://www.mikroe.com/easypic/
     Oscillator:      HS 8.000 MHz  (USB osc. is raised with PLL to 48.000MHz)
     Ext. Modules:    on-board USB-HID
     SW:              mikroC PRO for PIC
                      http://www.mikroe.com/mikroc/pic/
 * NOTES:
     (*) Be VERY careful about the configuration flags for the 18F4550 - there's
     so much place for mistake!
    - Place jumpers J12 in the right position
